Vehicles IV

# Create an instance of each child class. Access all their attributes and methods, including those inherited from their parent class Vehicle.

# TAKEAWAY! - Vehicle is the baseline class for other more specific types of vehicles. Typically, you wouldn't instantiate a Vehicle because the child classes are more useful for storing information about vehicles. The Vehicle class serves to create a relationship between its children. However, "submarine" might be created as a Vehicle because it's so rare that you might not need a full Submarine class!

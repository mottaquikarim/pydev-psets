"""
Dogs IV - Tricks (CHALLENGE!)
"""

# Many dogs know how to do common tricks or follow common commands. You could create methods for each trick/command in the Dog parent class, but the problem is that not all dogs know all tricks/commands. 

# However, it would be inefficient to define a custom set of instance methods for tricks/commands every time you instantiate a unique Collie (or SiberianHuskey or Pekingese etc.).

# Find an efficient way to specify which tricks each unique dog knows and to call them. You can use "roll_over", "fetch", "shake_hands", and "spin". Secondly, find a way to teach a dog new trick from this set.
